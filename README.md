getting to know GitHub

What'up folks! 

Arthur here, trying out the famous GitHub to have a feeling of what's it like to humbly share my codes and ideas so that I can better understand what crosses y'all minds once you see what I have to offer.

Let's all have some fun and spread out knowledge and creativity to make this place even greater. Peace out!
